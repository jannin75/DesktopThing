# DesktopThing
A project built using Arduino IDE, some TFT screens, and a raspberry pi pico

This was born out of frustration about the end of remote work and heading back into the office after almost 10 years.
I wanted to make a cute little display to show a slideshow and a nice looking clock to go with it.
A desftop thing to sit on my desk and display some images and the time.

Built using an ILI9341 with a capacitive touch screen and a round 1.28" tft display for the clock.
Uses the built in micro sd card clot on the ILI9341 and an external RTC clock with a battery to keep the time.
